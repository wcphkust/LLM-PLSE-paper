- [A Pair Programming Framework for Code Generation via Multi-Plan Exploration and Feedback-Driven Refinement](../venues/ASE2024/paper_21.md), ([ASE2024](../venues/ASE2024/README.md))

  - **Abstract**: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved impressive performance on code generation. Although prior studies enhanced LLMs with prompting techniques and code refinement, they still struggle with complex programming problems due to rigid solution plans. In this paper, we draw on pair programming practices to propose PairCoder, a novel LLM-based framework for code generation. PairCoder incorporates ...

- [CodePlan: Repository-Level Coding using LLMs and Planning](../venues/FSE2024/paper_20.md), ([FSE2024](../venues/FSE2024/README.md))

  - **Abstract**: Software engineering activities such as package migration, fixing error reports from static analysis or testing, and adding type annotations or other specifications to a codebase, involve pervasively editing the entire repository of code.     We formulate these activities as repository-level coding tasks.         Recent tools like GitHub Copilot, which are powered by Large Language Models (LLMs), ...

- [Experiential Co-Learning of Software-Developing Agents](../venues/ACL2024/paper_19.md), ([ACL2024](../venues/ACL2024/README.md))

  - **Abstract**: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have brought significant changes to various domains, especially through LLM-driven autonomous agents. A representative scenario is in software development, where LLM agents demonstrate efficient collaboration, task division, and assurance of software quality, markedly reducing the need for manual involvement. However, these agents frequently perf...

  - **Abstract**: Socratic questioning is an effective teaching strategy, encouraging critical thinking and problem-solving. The conversational capabilities of large language models (LLMs) show great potential for providing scalable, real-time student guidance. However, current LLMs often give away solutions directly, making them ineffective instructors. We tackle this issue in the code debugging domain with TreeIn...

- [Repairagent: An autonomous, llm-based agent for program repair](../venues/arXiv2024/paper_7.md), ([arXiv2024](../venues/arXiv2024/README.md))

  - **Abstract**: Automated program repair has emerged as a powerful technique to mitigate the impact of software bugs on system reliability and user experience. This paper introduces RepairAgent, the first work to address the program repair challenge through an autonomous agent based on a large language model (LLM). Unlike existing deep learning-based approaches, which prompt a model with a fixed prompt or in a fi...

- [Self-Planning Code Generation with Large Language Models](../venues/TOSEM2024/paper_2.md), ([TOSEM2024](../venues/TOSEM2024/README.md))

  - **Abstract**: Although large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive ability in code generation, they are still struggling to address the complicated intent provided by humans. It is widely acknowledged that humans typically employ planning to decompose complex problems and schedule solution steps prior to implementation. To this end, we introduce planning into code generation to help the model unde...

- [Symbolic Planning and Code Generation for Grounded Dialogue](../venues/EMNLP2023/paper_4.md), ([EMNLP2023](../venues/EMNLP2023/README.md))

  - **Abstract**: Large language models (LLMs) excel at processing and generating text and code. However, LLMs have had limited applicability in grounded task-oriented dialogue as they are difficult to steer toward task objectives and fail to handle novel grounding. We present a modular and interpretable grounded dialogue system that addresses these shortcomings by composing LLMs with a symbolic planner and grounde...

  - **Abstract**: Human intelligence thrives on cognitive synergy, where collaboration among different minds yield superior outcomes compared to isolated individuals. In this work, we propose Solo Performance Prompting (SPP), which transforms a single LLM into a cognitive synergist by engaging in multi-turn self-collaboration with multiple personas. A cognitive synergist is an intelligent agent that collaboratively...
