- [Automated Program Refinement: Guide and Verify Code Large Language Model with Refinement Calculus](../venues/POPL2025/paper_1.md), ([POPL2025](../venues/POPL2025/README.md))

  - **Abstract**: Recently, the rise of code-centric large language models (LLMs) appears to have reshaped the software engineering world with low-barrier tools like Copilot that can generate code easily. However, there is no correctness guarantee for the code generated by LLMs, which suffer from the hallucination problem, and their output is fraught with risks. Besides, the end-to-end process from specification to...

- [Bridging Gaps in LLM Code Translation: Reducing Errors with Call Graphs and Bridged Debuggers](../venues/ASE2024/paper_40.md), ([ASE2024](../venues/ASE2024/README.md))

  - **Abstract**: When using large language models (LLMs) for code translation of complex software, numerous compilation and runtime errors can occur due to insufficient context awareness. To address this issue, this paper presents a code translation method based on call graphs and bridged debuggers: TransGraph. TransGraph first obtains the call graph of the entire code project using the Language Server Protocol, w...

- [Concrat: An Automatic C-to-Rust Lock API Translator for Concurrent Programs](../venues/ICSE2023/paper_7.md), ([ICSE2023](../venues/ICSE2023/README.md))

  - **Abstract**: Concurrent programs suffer from data races. To prevent data races, programmers use locks. However, programs can eliminate data races only when they acquire and release correct locks at correct timing. The lock API of C, in which people have developed a large portion of legacy system programs, does not validate the correct use of locks. On the other hand, Rust, a recently developed system programmi...

- [Domain-specific transformer models for query translation](../venues/ACL2023/paper_11.md), ([ACL2023](../venues/ACL2023/README.md))

  - **Abstract**: Due to the democratization of e-commerce, many product companies are listing their goods for online shopping. For periodic buying within a domain such as Grocery, consumers are generally inclined to buy certain brands of products. Due to a large non-English speaking population in India, we observe a significant percentage of code-mix Hinglish search queries e.g., sasta atta. An intuitive approach ...

- [Enabling Memory Safety of C Programs using LLMs](../venues/arXiv2024/paper_10.md), ([arXiv2024](../venues/arXiv2024/README.md))

  - **Abstract**: Memory safety violations in low-level code, written in languages like C, continues to remain one of the major sources of software vulnerabilities. One method of removing such violations by construction is to port C code to a safe C dialect. Such dialects rely on programmer-supplied annotations to guarantee safety with minimal runtime overhead. This porting, however, is a manual process that impose...

- [Exploring and Unleashing the Power of Large Language Models in Automated Code Translation](../venues/FSE2024/paper_6.md), ([FSE2024](../venues/FSE2024/README.md))

  - **Abstract**: Code translation tools, namely transpilers, are developed for automatic source-to-source translation. Latest learning-based transpilers have shown impressive enhancement against rule-based counterparts in both translation accuracy and readability, owing to their task-specific pre-training on extensive monolingual corpora. Nevertheless, their current performance still remains unsatisfactory for pra...

- [Guess \& Sketch: Language Model Guided Transpilation](../venues/ICLR2024/paper_3.md), ([ICLR2024](../venues/ICLR2024/README.md))

  - **Abstract**: Maintaining legacy software requires many software and systems engineering hours. Assembly code programs, which demand low-level control over the computer machine state and have no variable names, are particularly difficult for humans to analyze. Existing conventional program translators guarantee correctness, but are hand-engineered for the source and target programming languages in question. Lea...

- [HECS: A Hypergraph Learning-Based System for Detecting Extract Class Refactoring Opportunities](../venues/ISSTA2024/paper_25.md), ([ISSTA2024](../venues/ISSTA2024/README.md))

  - **Abstract**: HECS is an advanced tool designed for Extract Class refactoring by leveraging hypergraph learning to model complex dependencies within large classes. Unlike traditional tools that rely on direct one-to-one dependency graphs, HECS uses intra-class dependency hypergraphs to capture one-to-many relationships. This allows HECS to provide more accurate and relevant refactoring suggestions. The tool con...

- [LPR: Large Language Models-Aided Program Reduction](../venues/ISSTA2024/paper_5.md), ([ISSTA2024](../venues/ISSTA2024/README.md))

  - **Abstract**: Program reduction is a widely used technique to facilitate debugging                compilers by automatically minimizing programs that trigger                compiler bugs. Existing program reduction techniques are either                generic to a wide range of languages (such as Perses and Vulcan)                or specifically optimized for one certain language by exploiting                la...

  - **Abstract**: Many software projects implement APIs and algorithms in multiple programming languages. Maintaining such projects is tiresome, as developers have to ensure that any change (e.g., a bug fix or a new feature) is being propagated, timely and without errors, to implementations in other programming languages. In the world of ever-changing software, using rule-based translation tools (i.e., transpilers)...

  - **Abstract**: Software migration is garnering increasing attention with the evolution of software and society. Early studies mainly relied on handcrafted translation rules to translate between two languages, the translation process is error-prone and time-consuming.

- [Refactoring programs using large language models with few-shot examples](../venues/APSEC2023/paper_1.md), ([APSEC2023](../venues/APSEC2023/README.md))

  - **Abstract**: A less complex and more straightforward program is a crucial factor that enhances its maintainability and makes writing secure and bug-free programs easier. However, due to its heavy workload and the risks of breaking the working programs, programmers are reluctant to do code refactoring, and thus, it also causes the loss of potential learning experiences. To mitigate this, we demonstrate the appl...

  - **Abstract**: Pythonic idioms are highly valued and widely used in the Python programming community. However, many  Python users find it challenging to use Pythonic idioms. Adopting rule-based approach or LLM-only approach is not sufficient to overcome three persistent challenges of code idiomatization including code miss, wrong detection and wrong refactoring. Motivated by the determinism of rules and adaptabi...

  - **Abstract**: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities in understanding and generating codes. Due to these capabilities, many recent methods are proposed to automatically refine the codes with LLMs. However, we should rethink that the refined codes (from LLMs and even humans) are not always more efficient than their original versions. On the other hand, running two different versio...

  - **Abstract**: As a relatively new programming language, Rust is designed to provide both memory safety and runtime performance. To achieve this goal, Rust conducts rigorous static checks against its safety rules during compilation, effectively eliminating memory safety issues that plague C/C++ programs. Although useful, the safety rules pose programming challenges to Rust programmers, since programmers can easi...
