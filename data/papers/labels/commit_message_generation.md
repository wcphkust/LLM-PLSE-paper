# Commit Message Generation

- [Automatic Commit Message Generation: A Critical Review and Directions for Future Work](../venues/TSE2024/paper_7.md), ([TSE2024](../venues/TSE2024/README.md))

  - **Abstract**: Commit messages are critical for code comprehension and software maintenance. Writing a high-quality message requires skill and effort. To support developers and reduce their effort on this task, several approaches have been proposed to automatically generate commit messages. Despite the promising performance reported, we have identified three significant and prevalent threats in these automated approaches: 1) the datasets used to train and evaluate these approaches contain a considerable amount...

  - **Abstract**: Code comment generation aims at generating natural language descriptions for a code snippet to facilitate developers' program comprehension activities. Despite being studied for a long time, a bottleneck for existing approaches is that given a code snippet, they can only generate one comment while developers usually need to know information from diverse perspectives such as what is the functionality of this code snippet and how to use it. To tackle this limitation, this study empirically investi...

- [Leveraging Context-Aware Prompting for Commit Message Generation](../venues/EMNLP2024/paper_29.md), ([EMNLP2024](../venues/EMNLP2024/README.md))

  - **Abstract**: Writing comprehensive commit messages is tedious yet important, because these messages describe changes of code, such as fixing bugs or adding new features. However, most existing methods focus on either only the changed lines or nearest context lines, without considering the effectiveness of selecting useful contexts. On the other hand, it is possible that introducing excessive contexts can lead to noise. To this end, we propose a code model COMMIT (Context-aware prOMpting based comMIt-message ...

- [Only diff Is Not Enough: Generating Commit Messages Leveraging Reasoning and Action of Large Language Model](../venues/FSE2024/paper_21.md), ([FSE2024](../venues/FSE2024/README.md))

  - **Abstract**: Commit messages play a vital role in software development and maintenance. While previous research has introduced various Commit Message Generation (CMG) approaches, they often suffer from a lack of consideration for the broader software context associated with code changes. This limitation resulted in generated commit messages that contained insufficient information and were poorly readable. To address these shortcomings, we approached CMG as a knowledge-intensive reasoning task. We employed Re...
