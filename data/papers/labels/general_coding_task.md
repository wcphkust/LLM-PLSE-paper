- [ART: A Unified Unsupervised Framework for Incident Management in Microservice Systems](../venues/ASE2024/paper_44.md), ([ASE2024](../venues/ASE2024/README.md))

  - **Abstract**: Automated incident management is critical for large-scale microservice systems, including tasks such as anomaly detection (AD), failure triage (FT), and root cause localization (RCL). Currently, most techniques focus only on a single task, overlooking shared knowledge across closely related tasks. However, employing isolated models for managing multiple tasks may result in inefficiencies, delayed responses, a lack of systemic perspective, and complexity in updates and operations. Therefore we pr...

- [Automating Code-Related Tasks Through Transformers: The Impact of Pre-Training](../venues/ICSE2023/paper_9.md), ([ICSE2023](../venues/ICSE2023/README.md))

  - **Abstract**: Transformers have gained popularity in the software engineering (SE) literature. These deep learning models are usually pre-trained through a self-supervised objective, meant to provide the model with basic knowledge about a language of interest (e.g., Java). A classic pre-training objective is the masked language model (MLM), in which a percentage of tokens from the input (e.g., a Java method) is masked, with the model in charge of predicting them. Once pre-trained, the model is then fine-tuned...

  - **Abstract**: Software development is a complex task that necessitates cooperation among multiple members with diverse skills. Numerous studies used deep learning to improve specific phases in a waterfall model, such as design, coding, and testing. However, the deep learning model in each phase requires unique designs, leading to technical inconsistencies across various phases, which results in a fragmented and ineffective development process. In this paper, we introduce ChatDev, a chat-powered software devel...

  - **Abstract**: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance on assisting humans in programming and facilitating programming automation. However, existing benchmarks for evaluating the code understanding and generation capacities of LLMs suffer from severe limitations.

  - **Abstract**: Large language models (LLMs) pretrained on vast source code have achieved prominent progress in code intelligence. However, existing code LLMs have two main limitations. First, they often adopt a specific architecture (encoder-only or decoder-only) or rely on a unified encoder-decoder network for different downstream tasks, lacking the flexibility to operate in the optimal architecture for a specific task. Secondly, they often employ a limited set of pretraining objectives which might not be rel...

  - **Abstract**: Solely relying on test passing to evaluate Large Language Models (LLMs) for code synthesis may result in unfair assessment or promoting models with data leakage. As an alternative, we introduce CodeMind, a framework designed to gauge the code reasoning abilities of LLMs. CodeMind currently supports three code reasoning tasks: Independent Execution Reasoning (IER), Dependent Execution Reasoning (DER), and Specification Reasoning (SR). The first two evaluate models to predict the execution output ...

A representative scenario is in software development, where LLM agents demonstrate efficient collaboration, task division, and assurance of software quality, markedly reducing the need for manual involvement. However, these agents frequently perform a variety of tasks independently, without benefiting from past experiences, which leads to repea...

  - **Abstract**: We systematically study how three large language models with code capabilities - CodeT5, Codex, and ChatGPT - generalize to out-of-domain data. We consider two fundamental applications - code summarization, and code generation. We split data into domains following its natural boundaries - by an organization, by a project, and by a module within the software project. We establish that samples from each new domain present all the models with a significant challenge of distribution shift. We study ...

  - **Abstract**: While the majority of existing pre-trained models from code learn source code features such as code tokens and abstract syntax trees, there are some other works that focus on learning from compiler intermediate representations (IRs). Existing IR-based models typically utilize IR features such as instructions, control and data flow graphs (CDFGs), call graphs, etc. However, these methods confuse variable nodes and instruction nodes in a CDFG and fail to distinguish different types of flows, and t...

However, despite their success, the majority of current models still represent code as a token sequence, which may not adequately capture the essence of the underlying code structure.In this work, we propose GrammarT5, a grammar-integrated encoder-decoder pretrained neural model for code.

  - **Abstract**: Semantic understanding of programs is a fundamental problem for programming language processing (PLP). Recent works that learn representations of code based on pre-training techniques in NLP have pushed the frontiers in this direction. However, the semantics of PL and NL have essential differences. These being ignored, we believe it is difficult to build a model to better understand programs, by either directly applying off-the-shelf NLP pre-training techniques to the source code, or adding feat...

  - **Abstract**: Self-consistency (SC), leveraging multiple samples from LLMs, shows significant gains on various reasoning tasks but struggles with free-form generation due to the difficulty of aggregating answers. Its variants, UCS and USC, rely on sample selection or voting mechanisms to improve output quality. These methods, however, face limitations due to their inability to fully utilize the nuanced consensus knowledge present within multiple candidate samples, often resulting in suboptimal outputs. We pro...

Many recent publications have explored LLMs applied to various SE tasks. Nevertheless, a comprehensive understanding of the application, effects, and possible limitations of LLMs on SE is still in its early stages. To bridge this gap, we conducted a systematic literature review (SLR) on LLM4SE, with a particular focus on understanding how LLMs can be exploited to optimize processes and...

LLMs are accurate enough, on average, to replace core functionality, yet make basic mistakes that demonstrate a lack of robustness. An ecosystem of prompting tools, from intelligent agents to new programming languages, have emerged with different solutions for patching LLMs with other tools. In this work, we introduce MiniChain, an opinionated tool for LLM augmented programming, wit...

Most works attempt to process the code directly or use a syntactic tree representation, treating it like sentences written in a natural language. However, none of the existing methods are sufficient to comprehend program semantics robustly, due to structural features such as function calls, branching, and interchangeable order of statements. In this pa...

However, existing studies have predominantly focused on improving model performance, with limited attention given to other critical aspects such as model calibration. Model calibration, which refers to the accurate estimation of predictive uncertainty, is a vital consideration in practical applications. Therefore, in order to advance the understanding of model calibration in SE, we conduct a comprehe...

In few-shot learning, these models take as input a prompt, composed of natural language instructions, a few instances of task demonstration, and a query and generate an output. However, the creation of an effective prompt for code-related tasks in few-shot learning has received little attention. We present a technique for prompt creation that automatically retrieves c...
