- **Abstract**: Code provides a general syntactic structure to build complex programs and perform precise computations when paired with a code interpreter -- we hypothesize that language models (LMs) can leverage code-writing to improve Chain of Thought reasoning not only for logic and arithmetic tasks, but also for linguistic ones (and in particular, those that are a mix of both). For example, consider prompting an LM to write code that counts the number of times it detects sarcasm in an essay: the LM may stru...
